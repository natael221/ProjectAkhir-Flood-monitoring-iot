# 🌊 Flood Monitoring IoT System

IoT-based flood monitoring system for **real-time detection of water level and flow rate** using **JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor** and **YF-S201 flow sensor**. Data is transmitted via **SIM800L GSM module** with **MQTT protocol**, processed by **Arduino Nano**, and displayed on a **monitoring dashboard**.  

📍 Developed as part of the **Final Project / Undergraduate Thesis** at **Politeknik Negeri Jakarta** (2025).

## 📌 Background

Flood-prone areas often lack a **reliable early warning system**. This project aims to design an IoT-based monitoring solution that continuously measures **water level and flow rate** and provides **early alerts** for potential flooding.

## 💡 Key Features

* 🌊 Real-time monitoring of water level (JSN-SR04T)  
* 💧 Flow rate measurement (YF-S201)  
* 📡 Data transmission using SIM800L (GSM 2G)  
* 🔔 LED-based early warning indicators (Safe / Alert / Danger)  
* 🌐 Web dashboard visualization via MQTT broker (HiveMQ)  

---

## 🧰 Hardware Components

* **Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)** – main controller  
* **JSN-SR04T Ultrasonic Sensor** – water level detection  
* **YF-S201 Flow Sensor** – water flow rate measurement  
* **SIM800L GSM Module** – MQTT data transmission  
* **LED Traffic Light Module** – early warning system  
* **Power Supply 5V / Step-down Converter**  
* **Project Box (IP-rated)** – outdoor protection  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Arduino IDE (C++)  
* MQTT Protocol (HiveMQ broker hosted on AWS EC2)  
* Python (data logging & analysis)  
* Web Dashboard for visualization

## 🔁 System Workflow

1. **Arduino Nano** reads:  
   * Water level from JSN-SR04T  
   * Flow rate from YF-S201  
2. Data is sent to **SIM800L GSM module**  
3. **SIM800L** publishes data to MQTT broker  
4. Data is displayed on **web dashboard**  
5. LED indicator signals system status
