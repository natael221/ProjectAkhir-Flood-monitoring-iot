# Flood Monitoring IoT System

IoT-based flood monitoring system with real-time water level and flow rate detection using **JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor** and **YF-S201 flow sensor**. Data is transmitted via **SIM800L GSM module** using **MQTT protocol**, processed by **Arduino Nano**, and visualized through a monitoring dashboard.  

This project was developed as a **Final Project / Undergraduate Thesis** at **Politeknik Negeri Jakarta**.
